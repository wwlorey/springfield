## Overview

Cursus is the pipeline orchestration subsystem of sgf. It provides declarative TOML pipeline definitions for all commands.

A **cursus** (Latin: "a running, course, path") is a named pipeline comprising one or more **iters** (Latin: "journey, passage") — discrete execution stages that run sequentially. Each iter invokes a prompt via sgf's iteration runner (AFK) or `cl` (interactive), with sentinel files controlling transitions between iters.

Cursus provides:
- **Declarative pipeline definitions**: TOML files in `.sgf/cursus/` define the iter sequence, execution modes, iteration counts, and transition rules
- **Context passing between iters**: Each iter can produce a summary file; subsequent iters consume it via prompt injection
- **Sentinel-based transitions**: Well-known sentinel files signal success, rejection, revision, or exhaustion — controlling which iter runs next
- **Stall recovery**: When an iter exhausts its iterations, the pipeline enters a stalled state the user can inspect and resume
- **Unified command model**: Every `sgf <command>` resolves to a cursus definition, whether it has one iter or many. Single-iter cursus definitions are the standard way to define simple commands
- **Foundation for evolution**: The TOML format accommodates future trigger types (event-driven daemons, cursus chaining) without structural changes. Only manual triggers are supported initially

Cursus definitions follow the same layered resolution as prompts: project-local `./.sgf/cursus/` overrides global `~/.sgf/cursus/`.

## Architecture

Cursus is a module within the `springfield` crate. Pipeline definitions live in `.sgf/cursus/` as TOML files; runtime state lives in `.sgf/run/` as JSON. The module handles TOML parsing, iter sequencing, sentinel detection, context file management, and stall recovery.

## File Layout

      draft-presentation.md
```

## Code Location

Cursus is implemented in the `springfield` crate at `crates/springfield/src/cursus/`.

## Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `toml` (0.8) | TOML parsing for cursus definitions |
| `serde` (1, derive) | Deserialization of TOML and JSON run state |
| `serde_json` (1) | Run state serialization/deserialization |
| `uuid` (1, v4) | Run ID and session ID generation |
| `chrono` (0.4) | Timestamps for run metadata |
| `tracing` (0.1) | Structured logging |

These are part of the `springfield` crate's Cargo.toml (cursus is a module within springfield, not a separate crate).

Binary invocations (child processes, not crate-level dependencies):

| Binary | Source | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `cl` | crates/claude-wrapper/ | Agent invocation in both AFK and interactive modes |

Workspace crate dependencies (linked at compile time via springfield):

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `vcs-utils` (workspace) | Git operations (auto-push) |
| `shutdown` (workspace) | Graceful shutdown handling, ChildGuard |

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Cursus TOML not found (neither local nor global) | Exit 1: `unknown command: <name>` |
| Cursus TOML parse error | Exit 1: `failed to parse cursus definition: <path>: <error>` |
| Validation failure (duplicate iter names, missing transition targets, etc.) | Exit 1: descriptive error at parse time |
| `consumes` value has no matching `produces` in any iter | Warning at parse time (not an error — the producing iter may not have run yet on first pass) |
| Prompt file not found for an iter | Exit 1: `prompt not found: <path>` (checked at cursus load time, before execution starts) |
| Iter exhausts iterations (no sentinel found) | Pipeline enters stalled state. Run metadata updated. User notified with status and options |
| Sentinel file `.iter-reject` with no `on_reject` transition defined | Exit 1: `iter '<name>' signaled reject but no on_reject transition is defined` |
| Sentinel file `.iter-revise` with no `on_revise` transition defined | Exit 1: `iter '<name>' signaled revise but no on_revise transition is defined` |
| Run directory creation failure | Exit 1: `failed to create run directory: <error>` |
| Run metadata read/write failure | `tracing::error\!`, continue if possible (non-fatal for execution, fatal for resume) |
| `produces` file not written by agent | `tracing::warn\!` — continue to next iter. The consuming iter will run without that context. Not fatal because the agent may have communicated through other means (spec updates, pn comments) |
| Stale run directory from previous crashed run | Detected at startup. Previous run status updated to `interrupted` if still marked `running` |
| SIGINT/SIGTERM during iter execution | Delegated to sgf/cl signal handling. Pipeline status updated to `interrupted` on exit |

## Testing

### Unit Tests

#### `cursus/toml.rs`
- Parse valid single-iter cursus definition (e.g., `build.toml`)
- Parse valid multi-iter cursus definition with transitions (e.g., `spec.toml`)
- Parse cursus with `produces` and `consumes` fields
- Parse cursus with `banner` field (true, false, default)
- Reject duplicate iter names
- Reject transition targets that reference non-existent iters
- Reject `consumes` referencing non-existent `produces` keys
- Default values: `mode` defaults to `interactive`, `iterations` defaults to 1, `trigger` defaults to `manual`, `auto_push` defaults to false, `banner` defaults to false
- Alias validation: reject duplicate aliases, reject aliases that shadow cursus names

#### `cursus/runner.rs`
- Sentinel `.iter-complete` advances to next iter
- Sentinel `.iter-reject` follows `on_reject` transition
- Sentinel `.iter-revise` follows `on_revise` transition
- Missing sentinel with iterations exhausted enters stalled state
- Transition to a previous iter (back-edge) works correctly
- Final iter completion marks pipeline as completed
- `produces` file path is correctly constructed under run directory
- `consumes` files are correctly resolved and injected via `--append-system-prompt`
- Missing `produces` file emits warning but continues
- `banner` flag is passed to the iteration runner when true, omitted when false
- Iter with both `next` and `transitions` correctly uses transitions on reject/revise and `next` on complete

#### `cursus/state.rs`
- Run metadata serialization/deserialization roundtrip
- Status transitions: `running` → `completed`, `running` → `stalled`, `running` → `interrupted`
- Stale run detection (status `running` but PID not alive)
- Resume from stalled state restores correct iter position

#### `cursus/context.rs`
- `produces` file written to correct path: `.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md`
- `consumes` resolves files from run context directory
- Multiple `consumes` entries are concatenated in order for prompt injection
- Missing consumed file returns empty string with warning

### Integration Tests

Binary-level tests using `cargo test -p springfield`. Each test:
1. Creates a `tempfile::TempDir` with a cursus TOML and prompt files
2. Uses `SGF_AGENT_COMMAND` to mock agent execution
3. Verifies iter sequencing, sentinel transitions, and context file flow

| Test | Scenario | Asserts |
|------|----------|---------|
| Single-iter cursus | `build.toml` equivalent | Runs single iter, exits normally |
| Multi-iter happy path | discuss → draft → review → approve | All iters run in sequence, exit 0 |
| Reject transition | review signals `.iter-reject` | Pipeline jumps back to draft iter |
| Revise transition | review signals `.iter-revise` | Pipeline jumps to revise, then back to review |
| Context passing | discuss produces summary, draft consumes it | Summary content appears in draft's system prompt |
| Stall recovery | draft exhausts iterations | Pipeline enters stalled state, metadata persisted |
| Resume stalled | Load stalled run, resume | Pipeline continues from stalled iter |
| Layered resolution | Local cursus overrides global | Local TOML takes precedence |
| Banner flag | iter with `banner = true` | Iteration runner displays banner |

## TOML Format

## Cursus Definition

Each `.toml` file in `.sgf/cursus/` defines one cursus. The filename (minus `.toml`) is the cursus name and the `sgf` subcommand.

### Top-Level Fields

```toml
description = "Spec creation and refinement"
alias = "s"
trigger = "manual"
auto_push = true
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | string | required | Human-readable description of the cursus. Used by `sgf list` |
| `alias` | string | — | Short alias for the command (e.g., `"s"` for spec). Optional |
| `trigger` | string | `"manual"` | How the cursus is started. Only `"manual"` is supported initially |
| `auto_push` | bool | `false` | Auto-push after commits (applies to all iters unless overridden) |

### Iter Definition

Iters are defined as an array of tables using `[[iter]]` (singular):

```toml
[[iter]]
name = "discuss"
prompt = "spec-discuss.md"
mode = "interactive"
iterations = 1
produces = "discuss-summary"
consumes = []
auto_push = false
banner = false

[[iter]]
name = "draft"
prompt = "spec-draft.md"
mode = "afk"
iterations = 10
produces = "draft-presentation"
consumes = ["discuss-summary"]
auto_push = true
banner = true

[[iter]]
name = "review"
prompt = "spec-review.md"
mode = "interactive"
consumes = ["discuss-summary", "draft-presentation"]

  [iter.transitions]
  on_reject = "draft"
  on_revise = "revise"

[[iter]]
name = "revise"
prompt = "spec-revise.md"
mode = "afk"
iterations = 5
consumes = ["discuss-summary", "draft-presentation"]
produces = "draft-presentation"
next = "review"

[[iter]]
name = "approve"
prompt = "spec-approve.md"
mode = "interactive"
consumes = ["draft-presentation"]
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | required | Unique identifier for this iter within the cursus |
| `prompt` | string | required | Prompt file name, resolved via layered `.sgf/prompts/` lookup |
| `mode` | `"interactive"` or `"afk"` | `"interactive"` | Execution mode |
| `iterations` | u32 | `1` | Max iterations for this iter (only meaningful for `afk` mode) |
| `produces` | string | — | Key name for the summary file this iter writes. Stored at `.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md` |
| `consumes` | array of strings | `[]` | Keys of summary files from previous iters, injected into this iter's system prompt |
| `auto_push` | bool | cursus-level default | Override auto-push for this specific iter |
| `banner` | bool | `false` | Whether the iteration runner displays the ASCII art startup banner. Default off |
| `next` | string | — | Override: after completion, go to this iter instead of the next in the list |
| `transitions` | table | — | Named transition overrides triggered by sentinel files |

### Transitions Table

```toml
[iter.transitions]
on_reject = "draft"
on_revise = "revise"
```

| Field | Sentinel File | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `on_reject` | `.iter-reject` | Jump to named iter on rejection |
| `on_revise` | `.iter-revise` | Jump to named iter for minor revision |

Transition targets must reference an iter name defined in the same cursus. This is validated at parse time.

An iter can define both `next` and `transitions`. They do not conflict — transitions take precedence when their sentinel is present; `next` only applies on successful completion (`.iter-complete`).

### Single-Iter Cursus

A single-iter cursus defines a simple command:

```toml
# build.toml
description = "Implementation loop"
alias = "b"
auto_push = true

[[iter]]
name = "build"
prompt = "build.md"
mode = "interactive"
iterations = 30
banner = true
```

### Validation Rules

Enforced at parse time (before any iter executes):
1. Iter names must be unique within a cursus
2. Transition targets (`on_reject`, `on_revise`, `next`) must reference existing iter names
3. `consumes` values must match a `produces` value from some iter in the cursus (warning, not error — the produces iter may not have run yet on first pass)
4. Aliases must be unique across all cursus definitions in scope
5. Aliases must not shadow cursus file names
6. Prompt files must exist (resolved via layered lookup)



## Sentinel Protocol

Cursus uses well-known sentinel files for transition control. Sentinels are named `.iter-*` — named after what the signal is about (the iter), not any specific tool.

### Sentinel Files

| File | Meaning | Cursus Behavior |
|------|---------|-----------------| 
| `.iter-complete` | Iter succeeded | Advance to next iter (or `next` override). If this is the final iter, pipeline completes |
| `.iter-reject` | Iter rejected by reviewer | Follow `on_reject` transition. Error if no `on_reject` defined |
| `.iter-revise` | Minor revision requested | Follow `on_revise` transition. Error if no `on_revise` defined |

### Detection

After each `cl` invocation returns, sgf checks for sentinel files in priority order:

1. `.iter-complete` — highest priority. If found alongside other sentinels, complete wins.
2. `.iter-reject` — checked second.
3. `.iter-revise` — checked third.
4. None found, iterations exhausted — treated as exhausted (pipeline enters stalled state).
5. None found, iterations remaining (interactive single-iteration iter) — treated as `.iter-complete` (interactive iters are assumed to complete in one invocation).

All detected sentinel files are deleted after processing. Sentinel search is recursive (depth <= 2) following the existing cleanup pattern.

### Interactive Iter Completion

Interactive iters (`mode = "interactive"`) with `iterations = 1` (the default) have special completion semantics: when the `cl` session ends without any sentinel file, the iter is treated as successfully completed. This is because interactive sessions end when the user is done — the absence of a rejection sentinel means implicit approval.

For interactive iters to signal rejection or revision, the agent must explicitly create `.iter-reject` or `.iter-revise` before the session ends. The prompt for review iters should instruct the agent to do this based on user feedback.

## Context Passing

Context passing allows iters to share information without a dedicated messaging tool. Each iter can produce a summary file that subsequent iters consume via prompt injection.

### Produces

When an iter defines `produces = "discuss-summary"`, the agent is expected to write a summary file at the end of its execution. The prompt for that iter should instruct the agent where to write and what to include.

The file path is: `.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md`

The cursus runner creates the `context/` directory before the iter starts. The agent writes the file as part of its normal execution (via `Write` tool or `Bash`).

If the agent fails to write the file, the cursus runner emits a warning but continues. This is non-fatal because:
- The agent may have communicated through other means (spec updates in `fm`, pn comments)
- The consuming iter's prompt should be resilient to missing context

### Consumes

When an iter defines `consumes = ["discuss-summary", "draft-presentation"]`, the cursus runner:

1. Reads each file from `.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md`
2. Concatenates them in order, with a header per file:
   ```
   === Context from iter: discuss (discuss-summary) ===

   <file contents>

   === Context from iter: draft (draft-presentation) ===

   <file contents>
   ```
3. Injects the concatenated content via `--append-system-prompt` to `cl`

The header includes both the iter name and the key name so the consuming agent knows the provenance of each context block. The iter name in the header reflects whichever iter last wrote the file — when `revise` overwrites a key originally produced by `draft`, the header shows `revise`, not `draft`.

### Produces Overwriting

When multiple iters produce the same key (e.g., both `draft` and `revise` produce `draft-presentation`), the later iter's file overwrites the earlier one. This is intentional: the revise iter produces an updated presentation that supersedes the draft's version. Subsequent consumers always get the latest version.

To track which iter last wrote each key, the cursus runner maintains a mapping of key → iter name in `meta.json` (`context_producers` field). After post-iter evaluation, if the iter defines a `produces` key and the file exists at `.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md`, the mapping is updated. If the file does not exist, the mapping is left unchanged and a warning is emitted.

### Environment Variable

The run context directory path is set as an environment variable `SGF_RUN_CONTEXT=.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/` so agents can reference it programmatically in prompts. This is a relative path from the repo root.

## Run State

Each cursus execution creates a run, tracked by metadata in `.sgf/run/`.

### Run ID Format

`<cursus-name>-<timestamp>` — e.g., `spec-20260317T140000`. Same format as the existing loop ID.

### Run Directory

`.sgf/run/<run-id>/` contains:

```
.sgf/run/spec-20260317T140000/
  meta.json           # run metadata
  context/            # produced summary files
    discuss-summary.md
    draft-presentation.md
  spec-20260317T140000.pid   # PID file (while running)
```

### Run Metadata (`meta.json`)

```json
{
  "run_id": "spec-20260317T140000",
  "cursus": "spec",
  "status": "running",
  "current_iter": "draft",
  "current_iter_index": 1,
  "iters_completed": [
    {
      "name": "discuss",
      "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "completed_at": "2026-03-17T14:05:00Z",
      "outcome": "complete"
    }
  ],
  "context_producers": {
    "discuss-summary": "discuss"
  },
  "mode_override": null,
  "created_at": "2026-03-17T14:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-17T14:10:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `run_id` | string | Unique run identifier |
| `cursus` | string | Name of the cursus being run |
| `status` | string | `running`, `completed`, `stalled`, `interrupted` |
| `current_iter` | string | Name of the iter currently executing (or stalled at) |
| `current_iter_index` | u32 | Position in the iters array (for ordered resumption) |
| `iters_completed` | array | Record of each completed iter with session ID, timestamp, and outcome |
| `context_producers` | object | Mapping of produces key → iter name that last wrote it. Updated whenever an iter successfully writes its `produces` file |
| `mode_override` | string or null | CLI mode override (`-a` or `-i`) that applies to all iters |
| `created_at` | string | RFC3339 timestamp |
| `updated_at` | string | RFC3339 timestamp (updated after each iter) |

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `running` | Pipeline is actively executing an iter |
| `completed` | All iters finished successfully (final iter produced `.iter-complete`) |
| `stalled` | An iter exhausted its iterations without completing |
| `interrupted` | Pipeline was interrupted by signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM) |

### Stall Recovery

When a pipeline enters the `stalled` state:

1. Run metadata is persisted with `status: "stalled"` and `current_iter` set to the stalled iter
2. The cursus runner prints a stall banner:
   ```
   ╭─ Cursus STALLED ─────────────────────────────────╮
   │  Cursus:    spec                                  │
   │  Iter:      draft                                 │
   │  Reason:    Iterations exhausted (10/10)          │
   │                                                   │
   │  To resume: sgf resume spec-20260317T140000       │
   ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
   ```
3. The runner exits with code 2

When the user runs `sgf resume <run-id>`:
1. Load `meta.json` from the run directory
2. Present the stalled state: which iter stalled, how many iterations were used, what context was accumulated
3. Offer options:
   - **Retry**: Re-run the stalled iter with the same iteration count
   - **Skip**: Advance to the next iter (if the user deems the iter's work sufficient)
   - **Abort**: Mark the run as interrupted and exit
4. Continue the pipeline from the chosen point

### Resume Integration

`sgf resume` supports both cursus run resumes and legacy session resumes:
- If the argument matches a `.sgf/run/<id>/meta.json` with cursus metadata, it's a cursus resume
- Otherwise, fall back to the session-resume behavior (see [session-resume spec](session-resume.md))

## Iter Execution

### Execution Flow

For each iter in the cursus (starting from the first, or from the resume point):

1. **Pre-iter setup**:
   - Create/verify run context directory
   - Update `meta.json` with `current_iter` and `status: "running"`
   - Clean stale sentinel files (`.iter-complete`, `.iter-reject`, `.iter-revise`)
   - Resolve `consumes` files and build system prompt injection content
   - Set environment: `SGF_RUN_CONTEXT` (relative path from repo root)

2. **Invoke iter**:
   - **AFK mode**: Invoke `cl` via sgf's iteration runner with the iter's prompt, iterations, banner flag, and consumed context via `--append-system-prompt`. Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--print`, `--output-format stream-json`.
   - **Interactive mode**: Invoke `cl` directly with the iter's prompt, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and consumed context via `--append-system-prompt`
   - The iteration runner handles agent invocation, NDJSON output formatting, terminal settings save/restore (tcgetattr/tcsetattr), stdout teeing to log files, and notification watching. See the [springfield spec](springfield.md) for full details.
   - A `ShutdownController` is created per-iter with `monitor_stdin` set based on the iter's effective mode: `true` for AFK iters (sgf owns stdin), `false` for interactive iters (stdin belongs to the agent). See the [shutdown spec's "Stdin EOF Detection" section](shutdown.md#stdin-eof-detection) for the rationale and behavior.
   - Session ID management: fresh UUID per `cl` invocation. See [session-resume spec](session-resume.md) for the full session metadata schema and `sgf resume` command.

3. **Post-iter evaluation**:
   - Check sentinel files in priority order (see Sentinel Protocol)
   - Record iter completion in `meta.json` (`iters_completed` array)
   - Check for `produces` file existence (warn if missing)
   - Determine next iter:
     a. `.iter-complete` → advance to `next` override or next in list
     b. `.iter-reject` → jump to `on_reject` target
     c. `.iter-revise` → jump to `on_revise` target
     d. Exhausted (no sentinel, iterations used up) → enter stalled state
     e. Interactive with no sentinel → treat as complete (advance)

4. **Termination**:
   - If the completed iter is the last in the list (and no `next` override): pipeline complete. Update status to `completed`, exit 0
   - If stalled: update status to `stalled`, print stall banner, exit 2
   - If interrupted: update status to `interrupted`, exit 130

### Mode Override

CLI flags `-a` and `-i` override the `mode` field for ALL iters in the cursus. This allows running an otherwise-AFK cursus interactively for debugging, or vice versa. The override is stored in `meta.json` as `mode_override`.

## Command Resolution Changes

The full command resolution order is owned by the [springfield spec](springfield.md) CLI Commands section. Cursus participates in steps 3-5 of that sequence (local cursus TOML → global cursus TOML → alias matching).

### What This Means

- All commands are defined by cursus TOML files. There is no fallback mechanism.
- Prompt files (`.sgf/prompts/*.md`) remain unchanged — they are referenced by cursus definitions but not directly resolved by `sgf`.
- The layered resolution logic (local → global) is the same, applied to `.sgf/cursus/`.
- Adding a new command is as simple as creating a new `.toml` file in `.sgf/cursus/`.

### CLI Changes

No CLI changes. `sgf build -a -n 30` works as expected. The flags map to:
- `-a` → `mode_override: "afk"` (overrides iter-level `mode`)
- `-n 30` → overrides `iterations` on all iters (or on the single iter for single-iter cursus)
- `--no-push` → overrides `auto_push` to false on all iters

## Design Decisions

### Why TOML

TOML was chosen over YAML (whitespace sensitivity, implicit typing footguns), a custom DSL (parser maintenance cost), Rust DSL (requires recompilation), and Markdown (fragile parsing). TOML is consistent with the Rust ecosystem (Cargo.toml), provides strong typing via serde deserialization, and catches config errors at parse time.

### Why Annotated-Linear Over Graph

Iters are an ordered list (the happy path is readable top-to-bottom) with optional transition overrides for back-edges. This was chosen over a full graph model (harder to scan, requires explicit `start` node and `transitions` arrays) and a purely linear model (can't express review loops). The annotated-linear approach keeps simple cursus definitions simple while supporting the review/revise cycles needed for spec refinement.

### Why Sentinel Files Over Exit Codes

Exit codes are limited (one integer) and consumed by sgf's existing protocol (0=complete, 2=exhausted). Sentinel files allow multiple distinct signals, are the established pattern, and are visible/debuggable on disk.

### Why Context Passing Via Prompt Injection

Five alternatives were evaluated: accumulating context files, structured handoff files, using fm specs as context, pipeline-scoped variables, and prompt injection. Prompt injection was chosen because it requires no new tooling (uses existing `--append-system-prompt`), the cursus runner handles it transparently, and agents receive context exactly where they need it — in their prompt. The tradeoff is that agents must write a summary file, but this is a simple prompt instruction.

### Why Unified Command Model

All commands resolve to cursus definitions — a single-iter cursus is functionally identical to a raw prompt invocation. This provides one mental model for users and eliminates the need for separate configuration mechanisms.

### Why `iter` Not `stage`

"Iter" (Latin: journey, passage) aligns with the project's Latin naming convention (forma, pensa, cursus). Each iter is a discrete passage through the pipeline.

### Why `[[iter]]` Not `[[iters]]`

TOML array tables use `[[iter]]` (singular) to match the naming convention of defining one iter per table entry. Each `[[iter]]` block defines a single iter; TOML's array-of-tables syntax naturally pluralizes by repetition.


## Future Evolution

The cursus TOML format and runtime are designed to accommodate future capabilities without structural changes. These are explicitly out of scope for the initial implementation but inform the design.

### Event-Driven Triggers

The `trigger` field currently only supports `"manual"`. Future values:

```toml
# Watch for new pn issues of type "bug"
trigger = { watch = "pn", filter = { type = "bug", status = "open" } }

# Watch for fm spec status changes
trigger = { watch = "fm", filter = { status = "stable" } }

# Triggered by another cursus completing
trigger = { on_complete = "fix" }

# Periodic polling
trigger = { interval = "5m" }

### Daemon Cursus

Cursus definitions with non-manual triggers run as background daemons, continuously watching for events and spawning pipeline runs. This enables a reactive agent ecosystem where bugs trigger fix pipelines, fixes trigger spec amendments, and spec changes trigger verification.

### Cursus Chaining

A cursus can trigger another cursus on completion:

```toml
on_complete = "verify-cohesion"
```

Combined with event triggers, this enables multi-pipeline workflows: fix → amend-spec → verify-cohesion.

### Cross-Cursus Context

When cursus A triggers cursus B, context from A's run may need to flow into B. The `consumes` mechanism can extend to reference other run IDs:

```toml
consumes = ["<run-id>:fix-summary"]
```

The summary file path structure (`.sgf/run/<run-id>/context/<key>.md`) already supports this — it's just a matter of resolving paths across run directories.

### Concurrency Management

Multiple daemon cursus running simultaneously introduces contention. Mitigations already in place:
- `pn update --claim` provides atomic issue claiming
- Git handles file-level merge conflicts

Additional mechanisms needed for daemon mode:
- Run-level locking to prevent duplicate pipeline runs for the same trigger event
- Priority queuing for approval iters (user can only review one at a time)
- Rate limiting to prevent runaway pipeline spawning
