Read `memento.md`.

Have a discussion and interview me about a new bug I want to report.

Information I might provide includes screenshots, logs, and descriptions. Your role is to capture the bug with enough detail for another agent to understand and fix it.

Ask clarifying questions:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant context (which feature, which spec, error messages)

When you have enough detail, log the bug:
`pn create "descriptive title" -t bug [-p <priority>] [--description "detailed description"]`

**Commit the changes.**
